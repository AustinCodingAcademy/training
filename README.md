# Instructor Training

During this training, you will work in 3 domains: Planning, Teaching, and Professionalism. Each domain consists of several sub-domains. The subdomains link to their own pages. These pages include links to readings, videos, form questions, and outside activities. Your progress through the training modules will be tracked and you will receive feedback.
