  <h1>Instructor Training</h1>
    <p>During this training, you will work in 3 domains: Planning, Teaching, and Professionalism. Each domain consists of
      several assets. The assets link to their own sections. These sections include links to readings, videos, form
      questions, and outside activities. Your progress through the training modules will be tracked and you will receive
      feedback. Reach out to clofton@austincodingacademy.com with any questions.

          Our mission at Austin Coding Academy is to get 100,000 people into tech careers that otherwise wouldn't be. Why? We believe that due to a lack of educational options, the tech community is missing in diversity. We believe that through effective and compassionate education everyone can learn to code. Bringing more people into tech is important because the tech community is literally building our future. Not only is this important for our society as a whole, but many people have a lot of potential they are not accessing in their current careers. We want to be the difference in these peoples' lives. We want to be the bridge to their better future. We want to empower them to create their own future - to become the developers and entrepreneurs our world needs.

        <ul>
          <li>We empower our students to transform their future by learning technical skills.</li>
          <li>By succeeding in our mission, we will benefit our community.</li>
